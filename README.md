# FALSE

This is a FALSE interpreter written in Haskell. It possibly holds the record for the
biggest FALSE compiler available (at the time of writing 2.2 MB!).

The interpreter consists of a back-end and a front-end. The back-end is called FalseLib
and can be used in any Haskell program. It parses and interprets FALSE code.

One front-end is shipped as FalseExec.
